### Technologies
This application is created with:
- .NET 6.0
- C#
- XAML
- WPF

### Setup
To run this application, you will need to clone this repository and build the project in Visual Studio 2022 to create the exe. 

### Features
- Gets inputs of user's name, gender, height and weight. A MessageBox will pop-up when an invalid input is made for either the height TextBox or the weight TextBox or both.
- When the calculate button is clicked, the user's BMI is calculated and displayed in the Label content below.
- The reset button takes the application back to its default state.

### Limitation
- BMI is not always an accurate measure of health because it cannot account for the difference between muscle and fat.
